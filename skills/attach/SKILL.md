# Attaching a repository to this overlay

1. Find the project's name — the `[project] name` in its `stayfixed.toml` — and check that
   `projects/<name>/` exists here. If it does not, this repository has not been bound yet and
   the directory is created by the command below.
2. Run `stayfixed attach --store PATH --check` first, where `PATH` is this overlay's own
   `projects/<name>/memory`. It reports whether the record binds this repository's remote and
   what permissions would change, and writes nothing. That path is the only one accepted;
   anything else is refused.
3. Relay that diff and wait for an answer. The command refuses to widen a permission without
   `--yes`, so this step is how a person comes to give it rather than what stands in for it.
   Once they agree, run the same command with `--yes` instead of `--check`, and relay what it
   wrote.
4. Personal rules, notes and permissions live here and nowhere else. Never copy one into the
   project repository, and never widen a permission on the user's behalf.
